Release Notes for Version Feature B - a section with multiple subsections that list the update status of features and bugs in the latest version. Section include:
Ghost feature- The ghost brings in a lose condition and also functions with the tapping mechanic to provide a threat to the player. 
Feature A was changed as it now requires the nails to be hit in the order they spawn in.
